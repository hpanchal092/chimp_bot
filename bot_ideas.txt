- Better bot logging
 	- Logs when it goes online
	- Logs when it adds roles and who it adds too
	- Logs when and who it kicks 
 	- etc.

 - Kick people on word list
 	- Source word list from a seperate file, bot auto updates based on command

 - Auto add roles
 	- Role names are stored in a seperate file, bot auto updates based on command

 - Kick command that starts a vote on whether someone should be kicked 
 	- If the vote reaches three people, person will be kicked from the server
 	- Silence option that doesn't kick the user, but server mutes/chat mutes them for 10 minutes, optional to change the time
